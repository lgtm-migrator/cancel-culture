Want a website that shows the top cancelled people or things? This is it! Cancel your friends, relatives, or that weird food item sitting in the back of your fridge since last year.

- Dislike a particular letter? **Cancel it!**
- Your pencil tip broke? **Cancel it!**
- Weather not great? **Cancel it!**

The possibilities are endless. And we support plurals too! Cancelling a group has never been easier.

## FAQ

- Q: _It's spelled 'canceled'._
  - A: That's not a question. Also no. Ew.

## Stack

- **[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**. Honestly it's not necessary (since Svelte has component-scoped styling) and probably makes things more cluttered and bad but whatever.
- **[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)**. I love it. It's great. Honestly could've used something else but API endpoints are easier, components are cool, everything is easier.
- **[Upstash](https://upstash.com/)**. Never used it before, but has a nice free tier (that I'm hoping I won't exceed) and it's a simple Redis KV store. Probably overkill since I'm literally using one sorted set, but eh.
- **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)**. Normally I'd use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), but they don't have wildcard domains which is the whole point of this. smh
- **[Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/)**. idk if domains count as part of the stack but I use Porkbun for domains becuase they're cheap and also have everything I need.

(Note: This is a fun thing I thought would be fun. It is a joke (like everything else I do). Please do not abuse this site or use it to abuse others. I was going to do \*.is/areloved.com but those domains weren't available. Sad!)
